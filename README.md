# Argania-Tree-Deforestation-Detection

The project focuses on addressing the urgent issue of deforestation in the Argania region, which is home to the unique and important Argania tree found primarily in Morocco. The Argania tree plays a crucial role in the ecosystem and economy of the region, but it is facing several threats that endanger its survival.

The major dangers to the Argania tree include over-harvesting for its valuable nuts, habitat destruction due to human activities, the impact of climate change on its adaptation, and overgrazing by goats. To protect the Argania tree and its habitat, the project aims to implement sustainable harvesting practices, restore natural habitats, and manage the grazing of goats.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect deforestation in the Argania region, aiding conservation efforts and preserving the unique ecosystem of the area.
